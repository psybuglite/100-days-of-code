# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created a PSD mockup for a web UI I'll start with.

**Thoughts:** There's no better way to sharpen my design and coding skills than to practice consistently. Building mockups from scratch is not as peachy as I initailly imagined it to be. But I had fun doing it

### Day 1: January 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've started coding the web UI.

**Thoughts** Making out time to code is quite the challenge for most people as I learnt today. I always kept it in mind that I MUST code for at least an hour today. So, I made out time to do just that.

### Day 2: January 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Continued coding the web UI.

**Thoughts** Still trying to balance work and coding time.. almost didn't make it today.

### Day 3: January 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Continued coding the web UI.

**Thoughts** Again.. squeezing out time is a challenge. I don't want to continue squeezing out time. I want to spend more than a few hours on this.
